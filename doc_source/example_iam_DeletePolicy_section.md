    public static void deleteIAMPolicy(IamClient iam,String policyARN) {

        try {
            DeletePolicyRequest request = DeletePolicyRequest.builder()
                .policyArn(policyARN)
                .build();

            iam.deletePolicy(request);
            System.out.println("Successfully deleted the policy");

        } catch (IamException e) {
            System.err.println(e.awsErrorDetails().errorMessage());

#### [ JavaScript ]

**SDK for JavaScript V3**  
 To learn how to set up and run this example, see [GitHub](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/javascriptv3/example_code/iam/#code-examples)\. 
Create the client\.  

```
import { IAMClient } from "@aws-sdk/client-iam";
// Set the AWS Region.
const REGION = "REGION"; // For example, "us-east-1".
// Create an IAM service client object.
const iamClient = new IAMClient({ region: REGION });
export { iamClient };
```
Delete the policy\.  

```
// Import required AWS SDK clients and commands for Node.js.
import { iamClient } from "./libs/iamClient.js";
import { DeletePolicyCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-iam";

// Set the parameters.
const params = { PolicyArn: "POLICY_ARN"};

const run = async () => {
    try {
        const data = await iamClient.send(new DeletePolicyCommand(params));
        console.log("Success. Policy deleted.", data);

    } catch (err) {
        console.log("Error", err);
    }
};
run();
