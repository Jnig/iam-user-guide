# How IAM users sign in to your AWS account<a name="getting-started_how-users-sign-in"></a>

After you create IAM users \(with passwords\), those users can sign in to the AWS Management Console\. To sign in, they need your account ID or alias\. They can also sign in from a custom URL that includes your account ID\. 

**Note**  
We recommend that you require your human users to use temporary credentials when accessing AWS\. Have you considered using AWS IAM Identity Center \(successor to AWS Single Sign\-On\)? You can use IAM Identity Center to centrally manage access to multiple AWS accounts and provide users with MFA\-protected, single sign\-on access to all their assigned accounts from one place\. With IAM Identity Center, you can create and manage user identities in IAM Identity Center or easily connect to your existing SAML 2\.0 compatible identity provider\. For more information, see [What is IAM Identity Center?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html) in the *AWS IAM Identity Center \(successor to AWS Single Sign\-On\) User Guide*\.

Before you create a sign\-in URL for your account, you create an account alias so that the URL includes your account name instead of an account ID\. For more information, see [Your AWS account ID and its alias](console_account-alias.md)\. 

You can find the sign\-in URL for an account on the **Dashboard** page in the IAM console\.

![\[IAM dashboard, sign-in URL\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/images/account_alias.console.png)

To create a sign\-in URL for your IAM users, use the following pattern:

```
https://account-ID-or-alias.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
```

IAM users can also sign in at the following endpoint and enter the account ID or alias manually, instead of using your custom URL:

```
https://signin.aws.amazon.com/console
```

## Permissions required for console activities<a name="console_signin-permissions-required"></a>

IAM users in your account have access only to the AWS resources that you specifically allow in a policy that applies to them\. For example, the policy could be attached to the user, to a group they belong to, to a role they assume, or to a resource that allows them access\.

To work in the console, users must have permissions to perform the actions that the console performs, such as listing and creating AWS resources\. For more information, see [Access management for AWS resources](access.md) and [Example IAM identity\-based policies](access_policies_examples.md)\.

If users in your account need programmatic access, you can create an access key pair \(an access key ID and a secret access key\) for each user\. For more information, see [Managing access keys \(console\)](id_credentials_access-keys.md#Using_CreateAccessKey)\.

## Logging sign\-in details in CloudTrail<a name="console_signin-cloudtrail"></a>

If you enable CloudTrail to log sign\-in events, you must understand how CloudTrail logs the events\. CloudTrail includes global and Regions log entries\. Where a sign\-in event is logged in CloudTrail depends on how your users sign in\. For details, see [Logging IAM Events with CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/cloudtrail-integration.html)\.
